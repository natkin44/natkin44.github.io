       <p> My team, the Magen David Warriors, and I have been fortunate enough due to the hard work we've put in to make it to the championship game which will be played on Sunday. They are great players and with a strong effort will win. </p>
       <h3 id="nbateam"> My favorite NBA team</h3>
       <a href="http://www.nba.com/search#/cavaliers" target="_blank">Cavs News</a>
       <p> because of their pure dominance of the game, The Cleveland Cavaliers are my favorite team. Led by my favorite player, and 4-time MVP Lebron James and the flashy playmaking Kyrie Irving, ther Cavs are the top team in the east and a current favorite to win the NBA with their accusition of three point shooting Kyle Korver. </p>
